```diff
+ green (confirmed social media that found on the internet)
- red (not confirmed social media that found on the internet by using some probabilities algorithm)
```

## Next Step
- Upload to PyPi (allows user to download using PIP)
- Improve & clean up code
- Increase the search results
- Search result from pornography websites
- Search target name from dark web (still researching, hope can do it)
- Allows user to gather company information

Currently, I am learning Python, feel free to comment if any need to improve.
